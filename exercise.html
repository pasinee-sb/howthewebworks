<!-- Part1 -->
<!-- What is HTTP? -->

HTTP is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is governs how clients get data from, or send data to, a server.

<!-- What is a URL? -->

URL is Uniform Resource Locator, an address for internet resource.

<!-- What is DNS? -->

Short for Domain Name System, a system that takes human-readable URLs and converts them into IP addresses.

<!-- What is a query string? -->

The query string allows you to pass key-value pairs into the URL, in the format ?key1=value1&key2=value2...

<!-- List two HTTP Verbs and their use cases. -->

GET - get data from the server 
POST - send data to the server 

<!-- What is an HTTP request? -->

An HTTP request is a request from a client to a server which follows the HTTP protocol 

<!-- What is an HTTP response? -->

An HTTP response is a response from a server to a client which follows the HTTP protocol (eg sending back HTML/CSS/JS/etc)

<!-- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen. -->

Headers provide additional information about the request or the response. 
ex.
Request headers: Host, User-Agent, Accept, Cookie, Cache-Control
Response headers: Content-Type, Last-Modified, Set-Cookie, Cache-Control

<!-- What happens when you type a URL in a browser? -->

Browser resolves the name into an IP address using DNS and makes a request to that IP address, including headers (info about browser, any previous cookies, and other things)
The server sends a response (typically, HTML, with a status code (200 if it was sucessful)
The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc) then makes separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from the server for each


<!-- Part Two: Practice Tools

Using curl, make a GET request to the icanhazdadjoke.com API to find all jokes involving the word “pirate” -->
$curl htcurl -H "Accept: application/json" "https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search?term=pirate"

<!-- Use dig to find what the IP address is for icanhazdadjoke.com -->

$dig http://www.icanhazdadjoke.com


<!-- Make a simple web page and serve it using python3 -m http.server. Visit the page in a browser. -->
Part Three: Explore Dev Tools
Build a very simple HTML form that uses the GET method (it can use the same page URL for the action) when the form is submitted.

Add a field or two to the form and, after submitting it, explore in Chrome Developer tools how you can view the request and response headers.

Edit the page to change the form type to POST, refresh in the browser and re-submit. Do you still see the field in the query string? Explore in Chrome how you can view the request and response headers, as well as the form data.

Part Four: Explore the URL API
At times, it’s useful for your JavaScript to look at the URL of the browser window and change how the script works depending on parts of that (particularly the query string).

Read about the URL API

Try some of the code examples in the Chrome Console so that you can get comfortable with the basic methods and properties for instances of the URL class.
